### Case study:Rwanda

#### Overview
Epidemics of infectious diseases are occurring more often, and spreading faster and further than ever, in many different regions of the world. A potentially fatal combination of newly-discovered diseases, and the re-emergence of many long-established ones, demands urgent responses in all countries. During this initial, time-critical period, neither the central epidemiological parameters nor the effectiveness of interventions such as cancellation of public events, school closings, or social distancing is known.

#### Objective
The primary objective is to quantify the statistical significance of a public health policy introduced by Rwandan government to slow down the spread of COVID-19. 

#### Data
The data was retrieved from the John Hopkins University database. The data includes cases of the confirmed, recovered and infected with Covid19 for individuals in Rwanda. The data forms compartments namely; the susceptible, the infected and the recovered.
